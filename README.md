# ActivelySupported

Just a test app for Shoes that includes an external gem, in this case ActiveSupport (for realism).

This is for duplicating Shoes issue https://github.com/shoes/shoes4/issues/1245.

To show the problem run the following from this directory (with Shoes installed as a gem, at least `4.0.0.pre8`):

```
shoes -p swt:jar app.rb
```
